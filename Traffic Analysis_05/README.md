# Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and timezone. It also includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors. 
The analysis is performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The traffic accident data used for analysis should be provided in a CSV format. The dataset should contain relevant information such as:

- `TimeZone`: Timezone of the accident
- `Weather_Condition`: Weather conditions during the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy)
- `longitude`: Longitude of the accident location
- `latitude`: Latitude of the accident location

## Examples

The analysis includes several examples that can be customized or expanded based on your requirements:

- Analyzing accidents by road conditions
- Analyzing accidents by weather conditions
- Analyzing accidents by timezone
- Visualizing accident hotspots on a map
- Visualizing contributing factors to accidents
